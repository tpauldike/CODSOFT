# A Simple Calculator
Here is a simple calculator (that runs on the command line) with basic arithmetic operations.
It prompts the user to input two numbers and an operation choice, performs the calculation
and display the result. When the result is displayed, it prompts the user to either perform
another calculation or quit the program.

The calculator validates every input and only executes when the inputs are all valid, otherwise,
it will stop.

### How to use it
- Copy the codes here and save it as a file named `calc.py`
- Download and install `Python3`, if you don't have it already.
- Run `python3 calc.py`
